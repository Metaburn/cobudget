# Contributing to Cobudget User Interface

This document is forked from [io.js/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Issue Contributions

When opening new issues or commenting on existing issues on this repository
please make sure discussions are related to concrete technical issues with the
Cobudget User Interface software.

Discussion of non-technical topics including subjects like
high level project questions should move to the
[top-level repository](https://github.com/open-app/cobudget)
instead.

## Code Contributions

The Cobudget project welcomes new contributors. This document will guide you through the contribution process.

### Step 1: Fork

Fork the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/cobudget/cobudget-ui) and check out your
copy locally.

```text
$ git clone git@github.com:username/cobudget-ui.git
$ cd cobudget-ui
$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/cobudget/cobudget-ui.git
```

#### Which branch?

For developing new features and bug fixes, the `master` branch should be pulled
and built upon.

### Step 2: Branch

Create a feature branch and start hacking:

```text
$ git checkout -b my-feature-branch -t origin/master
```

### Step 3: Commit

Make sure git knows your name and email address:

```text
$ git config --global user.name "J. Random User"
$ git config --global user.email "j.random.user@example.com"
```

Writing good commit logs is important.  A commit log should describe what
changed and why.

### Step 4: Rebase

Use `git rebase` (not `git merge`) to sync your work from time to time.

```text
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/master
```

### Step 5: Test

Bug fixes and features **should come with tests**.  Add your tests in the
test directory within your module directory.  Look at other tests to see how they should be
structured (license boilerplate, common includes, etc.).

```text
$ npm test
```

TODO how to run individual tests

### Step 6: Push

```text
$ git push origin my-feature-branch
```

Go to https://github.com/yourusername/cobudget-ui and select your feature branch.
Click the 'Pull Request' button and fill out the form.

Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days.  If there are comments
to address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your
feature branch.  Post a comment in the pull request afterwards; GitHub does
not send out notifications when you add commits.

* (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
  have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated
  in the file; or
* (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
  of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license
  and I have the right under that license to submit that work with
  modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the
  same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a
  different license), as indicated in the file; or

## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from [Rust's wonderful
CoC](http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html).

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
  environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
  disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
  might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
  design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
  costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone.  That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term
  "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of
  Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of
  clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
  their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
  excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if
  you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
  by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any
  of the TC members immediately with a capture (log, photo, email) of
  the harassment if possible.  Whether you're a regular contributor or
  a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you
  and we've got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
  attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.
* Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
  documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining
  code (e.g. "When the developer")
